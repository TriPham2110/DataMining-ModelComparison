# DataMining-ModelComparison

This assignment helps provide hands-on epxerience with a comparison of different classification models for the problem of classifying whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign.

We are using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) Dataset. There are 699 samples in this dataset, and 16 of them contain missing values. For our approach, we imputed these 16 values using relevant information from other samples' feature values. For more information on the pipeline and results, please refer to the report in this repository.

# Compilation
Use `pip install -r requirements.txt -U` to install the required packages used in this project.

Then run `python main.py`.
